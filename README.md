# Local.Nuget.Feed
Internal Nuget Feed using Nuget.Server

This allows developers to publish their own Nuget packages to the feed for easy distribution within a team.
Limitation is that every developer shares the same key when publishing to the feed unlike Nuget Gallery where developers can login with their own account and upload Nuget packages using their own key
